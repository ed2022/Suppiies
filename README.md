HTML and CSS Tools

This is a project rapped around the use of HTML and CSS. 

I am learning the differents in layouts and sectionings. 

This will help me use the different tags and formations of verticle and horizontal lining to achieve a designer look. 

I am basing this on a resturant order menu.
